# Sensor-fusion-based-on-filtering-technique
 Investigation different methods to fuse data from different sensor like Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Magnetometer  for sensor fusion algorithm 
 
 
 
 
Data from multiple sensors are used in multiple areas e.g. Navigation,Gaming
For this purpose we need orientation, position and other information
To have this information in reliable way single sensor is not sufficient
Combine several sensors into a measurement system
